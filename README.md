### Introduction
- The reduction of an imageâ€™s size will allow us to store more image (or something else) since this action will create more free spaces in our hardware. In addition to the lower size, a compressed image appears to be easier and faster to be downloaded from the internet or uploaded to somewhere like website, social media, etc.
- K-Means clustering is a famous machine learning algorithm, which is categorized as unsupervised learning technique, involves in grouping the unlabeled dataset into K different clusters. And it can be used for compressing image.
